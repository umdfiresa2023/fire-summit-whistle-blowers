Competition 

 

We are subject to competition
in substantially all product and service areas. Some of our key competitors are:

  


·Aerospace: Borg-Warner (automotive), Garmin,
General Electric, Rockwell Collins, Thales and United Technologies



 


·Home and Building Technologies: Emerson
Electric, Itron, Johnson Controls, Schneider and Siemens



  


·Performance Materials and Technologies:
Albemarle, BASF, Dow, Dupont, Emerson and Sinopec



 


·Safety and Productivity Solutions: 3M,
Mine Safety Appliances, Kion Group, TE Connectivity and Zebra Technologies

  

Our businesses compete
on a variety of factors such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance, applied technology, product
innovation and product recognition. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our
products and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors include breadth of product line,
research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products
and services, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. Many of our competitors
have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with
the captive component divisions of OEMs. 

 

Aerospace Sales 

 

Our
Aerospace segment sales were 38%, 39% and 39% of our total sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Our sales to commercial
aerospace OEMs were 6%, 8% and 6% of our total sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014. In addition, our sales to commercial aftermarket
customers of aerospace products and services were 12%, 12% and 11% of our total sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014.

 

U.S. Government Sales

 

Sales to the U.S. Government
(principally by Aerospace), acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $3,330
million, $3,743 million and $3,693 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, which included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense, as
a prime contractor and subcontractor, of $2,647 million, $2,680 million and $2,792 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014. U.S. defense



4
    
    



spending decreased in 2016 compared to
2015. We do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2017 federal defense
spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEMs’ production, engineering development
programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs), as
well as our diversified commercial businesses.

 

Backlog

 

Our total backlog at
December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $19,075 million and $18,183 million. We anticipate that approximately $12,022 million of the 2016
backlog will be filled in 2017. We believe that backlog is not necessarily a reliable indicator of our future sales because a
substantial portion of the orders constituting this backlog may be canceled at the customer’s option.

 

International Operations 

 

We are engaged in manufacturing,
sales, service and research and development (R&D) globally. U.S. exports and non-U.S. manufactured products are significant
to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 13% of our total sales in 2016 and 14% in each of 2015 and 2014. Non-U.S. manufactured
products and services, mainly in Europe and Asia, were 43% of our total sales in 2016, 39% in 2015 and 41% in 2014.

Information related
to risks attendant to our foreign operations is included in Item 1A. Risk Factors under the caption “Macroeconomic and Industry
Risks.”

 

Raw Materials

 

The principal raw materials
used in our operations are generally readily available. Although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply,
we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials or commodities in 2016. We are not dependent on any
one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials.

 

The costs of certain
key raw materials, including R240, fluorspar, copper, ethylene and perchloroethylene in Performance Materials and Technologies
and nickel, steel, titanium and other metals in Aerospace, are expected to continue to fluctuate. We will continue to attempt
to offset raw material cost increases with formula or long-term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities where
feasible. We do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2017.

 

Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Distribution
Rights

 

Our segments are not
dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or distribution rights. In our judgment, our intellectual
property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents,
trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent, trademark or
any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our
total business.

 

Research and Development

 

The Company’s
principal research and development activities are in the U.S., India, Europe and China. Research and development expense totaled
$2,143 million, $1,856 million and $1,892 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014. R&D expense was 5% of sales in each of 2016, 2015
and 2014. Customer-sponsored (principally by the U.S. Government) R&D activities amounted to an additional $967 million, $998
million and $1,034 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014.



5
    
    




Environment

 

We are subject to various
federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regarding protection of human health and the environment. We believe
that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental
damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent
in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses.

 

We are and have been
engaged in the handling, manufacture, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies.
We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk
of environmental damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accord
with environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is also possible that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved
capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies,
could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances.

 

Among other environmental
requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been
designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating
sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Priority
List. Although there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup
costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, we do not anticipate having to bear significantly
more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole.

 

We do not believe that
existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have
a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Company’s business or markets that it serves, nor on its results of operations,
capital expenditures, earnings, competitive position or financial standing. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in
this area.

 

Employees

 

We have approximately
131,000 employees at December 31, 2016, of whom approximately 45,000 are located in the United States.

Item 1A. Risk Factors

 

Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements

 

We describe many of the
trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations and in other parts of this report (including this Item 1A). Such discussions contain forward-looking
statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

 

Forward-looking statements
are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will
or may occur in the future. They are based on management’s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends,
current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future
performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking
statements. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also
subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking statements
should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular, the factors discussed below.
These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.

 

Risk Factors

 

Our business, operating
results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the principal risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which
could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.

 

Macroeconomic and Industry Risks

 

Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the
markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results
of operations.

 

·Aerospace—Operating
results of Aerospace are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, as well as changes in customer buying
patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions and capacity constraints. The operating results of
our                                                                           Commercial Aviation business unit may be
adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel which impacts
new aircraft production or the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft,
the                                                                           retirement of aircraft and global flying
hours,                                                                           which impact air transport, regional,
business and general aviation aircraft
utilization rates. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for
the                                                                           product portfolio. Operating results in our
Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign
government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the
potential                                                                           introduction
of                                                                                                    counterfeit parts into
our global supply chain.
Operating results in our Transportation Systems business unit may be affected
by the level of production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, regulatory changes regarding
automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy, consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products and delays
in launch schedules for new automobile and truck platforms.

results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global residential and commercial construction activity (including
retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on building projects, less industrial plant expansion,
changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in
distribution channels. 

 


·Performance Materials and Technologies—Operating
results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor
plants, our customers’ availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply volatility,
product commoditization, and our ability to maximize our facilities’ production capacity and minimize downtime. In particular,
the volatility in oil and natural gas prices have and will continue to impact our customers’ operating levels and capital
spending and thus demand for our products and services.





8
    
    

·Safety and Productivity Solutions—Operating
results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global capital spending and operating expenditures, including
in the oil and gas industry, reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utilization initiatives,
fluctuations in retail markets, lower customer demand due to the failure to anticipate and respond to overall trends related to
end market demand, changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and technology that may lead to product commoditization,
and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices and lower margins.


 

An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is
in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international
operations.

 

Our international operations,
including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Company’s sales. Risks related to international operations include
exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws,
import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes), violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our
efforts to mitigate these risks), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of
private enterprises, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees
in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment, including the United Kingdom
referendum in favor of exiting the European Union and the evolving U.S. political, regulatory and economic landscape following
the 2016 elections, and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair
our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability
to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.

 

Operating outside of
the United States also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. However,
foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating
such volatility. Finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the United States that is invested with financial
and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash
or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties
with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss.

 

Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may
adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.

 

Significant changes in
actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations
and require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our
anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of
each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pension
contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns
on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations.

 

Operational Risks

 

Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers
to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our
ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.

 

The cost of raw materials
is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in Performance Materials and Technologies (R240, fluorspar, copper,
ethylene and perchloroethylene) and in Aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). Our inability to offset material price
inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions
or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations.

 

Many major components,
product equipment items and raw materials, particularly in Aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source
basis. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for
raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have
in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ inability
to scale





9
    
    

production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our inability to fill our supply
needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result
in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.

 

We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively
integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned.

 

We regularly review our
portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete
transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, and during integration we may discover cybersecurity and compliance
issues. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses
to meet or exceed expected returns including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into
Honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies; (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets
and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations difficulties
or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities, or with regard to
divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification.

 

Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability
to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with
acceptable margins.

 

Our future growth rate
depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets,
(ii) develop and maintain competitive products, (iii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors including
many new and non-traditional competitors, (iv) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products
from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (v) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products
to market quickly and cost-effectively, and (vi) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise
and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products.

 

The failure of our technologies
or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues
and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects.

 

Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational
improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may
reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses.

 

Our profitability and
margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings
benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive
regions and product line rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives,
additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale.
We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these
actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, attrition, labor relations difficulties, or
workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations.

 

As a supplier to the U.S. Government, we are subject to
unique risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations
of our operations and performance.

 

U.S. Government contracts
are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent
with the terms of the applicable contract. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject
to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes. When appropriate and prudent, we have made
adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future.

 

We are also subject to
government investigations of business practices and compliance with government





10
    
    





procurement regulations. If, as a result of any
such investigation or other government investigations (including investigation of violations of certain environmental, employment
or export laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, then it could be suspended from
bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal
proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended.

 

Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor
companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.

 

Mainly because of past
operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation
of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases
and exposures. We continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits
and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances.
Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. Various federal,
state, local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and can impose substantial fines
and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or
decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of
policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment
of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements
or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial
condition or results of operations.

 

Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations,
result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.

 

Global cybersecurity
threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT)
systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its
customers and/or its third party service providers including cloud providers. Our customers, including the U.S. government, are
increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional
costs to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and
incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent,
detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments,
product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems
and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and
scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential
or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. Cybersecurity incidents
aimed at the software imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product failures have caused a similar
range of damages to our customers, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products. The potential
consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft
of intellectual property, fines levied by the Federal Trade Commission, diminution in the value of our investment in research,
development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication
and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.

 

Legal and Regulatory Risks

 

Our U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in
part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate.

 

Our future results of
operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries
with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof),
changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in
the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns
and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes
estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments



11
    
    

of future earnings of the Company
which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including multi-jurisdictional
changes enacted in response to the guidelines provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to
address base erosion and profit shifting, and potential comprehensive U.S. tax reform which, among other things, might change certain
U.S. tax rules impacting the way U.S based multinationals are taxed, will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our
provision for income taxes.

 

Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies
can have a significant impact on our results of operations.

 

The sales and margins
of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety, performance and product certification
regulations. Within Aerospace, the operating results of Commercial Original Equipment and Commercial Aftermarket may be impacted
by, among other things, mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring
the installation of equipment on aircraft. Our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement
regulations, while emissions, fuel economy and energy efficiency standards for motor vehicles can impact Transportation Systems.
Within Home and Building Technologies, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by
fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Performance Materials and Technologies’
results of operations can be affected by environmental, safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Growth in all our
businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local
employment law mandates may be restrictive.

 

We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation
matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties.

 

We are subject to a
number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the
conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability
(including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property,
antitrust, import and export, and environmental, health and safety matters. Our potential liabilities are subject to change
over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may
become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results
of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance
coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant
liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash
flows, liquidity and financial condition.

Purchases of Equity Securities


 

Honeywell’s common
stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Market and dividend information for Honeywell’s common stock is included
in Note 24 Unaudited Quarterly Financial Information of Notes to Financial Statements.

 

The number of record
holders of our common stock at December 31, 2016 was 50,891.

 

Information regarding
securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is included in Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial
Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters under the caption “Equity Compensation Plans.”

 

Honeywell purchased 2,000,000
shares of its common stock, par value $1 per share, in the quarter ending December 31, 2016. Under the Company’s previously
reported $5 billion share repurchase program, of which $4.1 billion remained available as of December 31, 2016 for additional share
repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact
of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under
our savings plans. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of our operating,
financing and other investing activities.

Performance Graph

 

The following graph compares
the five-year cumulative total return on our common stock to the total returns on the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500
Stock Index and a composite of S&P’s Industrial Conglomerates and Aerospace and Defense indices, on a 65%/35% weighted
basis (the Composite Index). The weighting of the components of the Composite Index are based on our segments’ relative contribution
to total segment profit. The selection of the Industrial Conglomerates component of the Composite Index reflects the diverse and
distinct range of non-aerospace businesses conducted by Honeywell. The annual changes for the five-year period shown in the graph
are based on the assumption that $100 had been invested in Honeywell stock and each index on December 31, 2011 and that all dividends
were reinvested.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations


 

(Dollars
in millions, except per share amounts)

 

The following Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to help the reader understand the results
of operations and financial condition of Honeywell International Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (Honeywell or the Company)
for the three years ended December 31, 2016. All references to Notes relate to Notes to Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data.

 

In July 2016, the Company
announced the realignment of the business units comprising its Automation and Control Solutions
reporting segment by forming two new reportable operating segments: Home and Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity
Solutions. Home and Building Technologies includes Environmental & Energy Solutions, Security and Fire, and Building
Solutions and Distribution. Additionally, the Industrial Combustion/Thermal business, previously part of Environmental & Energy
Solutions in Automation and Control Solutions, became part of Performance Materials and Technologies. Safety
and Productivity Solutions includes Sensing & Productivity Solutions and Industrial Safety, as well as the Intelligrated
business. Under the realigned segment reporting structure, the Company has four reportable
operating segments: Aerospace, Home and Building Technologies, Performance Materials and Technologies, and Safety and Productivity
Solutions. The Company has reported its financial performance based on this realignment for all periods presented.

 

These realignments have
no impact on the Company’s historical consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Prior period
amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period segment presentation. 

 

On
September 16, 2016, the Company completed the sale of the Aerospace government services business, Honeywell Technology Solutions
Inc. The assets and liabilities associated with Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. have been removed from the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the effective date of the sale. The results of operations for Honeywell Technology Solutions are
included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations through the effective date of the sale. 


 

On
October 1, 2016, the Company completed the tax-free spin-off of its Resins and Chemicals business, part of Performance Materials
and Technologies, into a standalone, publicly-traded company (named AdvanSix) to Honeywell shareowners. The assets and liabilities
associated with AdvanSix have been removed from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the effective date of the
spin-off. The results of operations for AdvanSix are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations through the effective
date of the spin-off.

 

Executive summary

 

In 2016, Honeywell successfully
navigated a challenging macro-economic environment. We grew net sales 2% to $39,302 million, grew earnings per share of common
stock – assuming dilution 3% to $6.20 and grew net income attributable to Honeywell 1% to $4,809 million. We executed on
cost reduction activities, accelerated our capital deployment strategy and improved the growth portfolio through acquisitions and
divestitures, including the divestiture of Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. and the tax-free spin-off of AdvanSix. We also announced
the realignment of the business units comprising our Automation and Control Solutions segment to two new reportable operating segments,
as previously mentioned. The Company also announced a leadership succession plan for our Chief Executive Officer and successfully
executed leadership transitions in three of our four reportable operating segments.

 

We continued our balanced
long-term focus on enhancing shareowner value without sacrificing growth investment, including maintaining R&D spending at
5% of sales, new product introductions aligned with global macroeconomic trends in energy, safety, security, productivity and global
urbanization, over $300 million of new repositioning investments to improve our operations and increased investment in High Growth
Regions. We also continued to enhance our software capabilities through the creation of a software center in the United States
to staff more than 730 full-time product software engineers, who are in addition to the more than 11,000 software engineers already
part of Honeywell.



16
    
    


In 2016 we deployed capital
of over $7.5 billion, including the following:

 


·Mergers and Acquisitions—we
deployed over $2.5 billion during 2016, acquiring businesses that will be integrated into each of our four operating segments.
These acquisitions all share a software and technology focus and increase our existing deep alignment with enduring macro trends
such as energy efficiency, clean energy generation, safety, security, productivity and global urbanization.

   

·Dividend—after a 15%
dividend rate increase in 2015, we increased our annual dividend rate by 12% in 2016, as we seek to continue to grow the dividend
faster than earnings, marking the 12th dividend increase in the past 11 years.

   

·Share Repurchases—we
continue to opportunistically repurchase our shares with the goal of generally keeping share count flat and seeking to offset the
dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation and savings plans. In 2016, we repurchased 19.3 million shares for $2.1 billion.

   

·Capital Investment in Facilities—we
invested over $1 billion in capital expenditures focused on high return investments such as the expansion of facilities to manufacture
our Solstice® low global-warming potential refrigerant products and building new production facilities to make UOP catalyst
and absorbent products.

 

Honeywell also completed
refinancing of long-term debt through the issuance of €4,000 million Senior Notes in February and an additional $4,500 million
Senior Notes in October. The proceeds from the offerings of Senior Notes were used to repurchase $2,200 million of Senior Notes
outstanding, as well as repay outstanding commercial paper. We expect these refinancing activities will reduce our ongoing annual
interest expense.

and foreign currency translation), higher depreciation and amortization attributable to acquisitions of approximately $135 million
and increased pension mark-to-market expense allocated to cost of products and services sold of $70 million, partially offset by
higher pension and other postretirement benefits income allocated to cost of products and services sold of $200 million.

 

Gross margin percentage
increased in 2016 compared with 2015 principally due to higher gross margin in Performance Materials and Technologies (approximately
0.6 percentage point impact) and higher pension and other postretirement benefits income allocated to cost of products and services
sold (approximately 0.5 percentage point impact), partially offset by lower gross margin in Aerospace, Home and Building Solutions
and Safety and Productivity Solutions (approximately 0.7 percentage point impact collectively) and increased pension mark-to-market
expense allocated to cost of products and services sold (approximately 0.2 percentage point impact).

 

Cost of products and
services sold decreased in 2015 compared with 2014 principally due to a decrease in direct and indirect material costs of approximately
$1,460 million (driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, productivity, lower raw materials pass-through
pricing and the absence of the Friction Materials business, partially offset by higher sales volume), a decrease in labor costs
of approximately $450 million and higher pension income allocated to cost of products and services sold of approximately $230 million.

 

Gross margin percentage
increased in 2015 compared with 2014 principally due to higher gross margin in all of our business segments (approximately 2.0
percentage point impact collectively) and increased pension income allocated to cost of products and services sold (approximately
0.5 percentage point impact).

For discussion of changes
in the effective tax rate, see Note 5 Income Taxes in the Notes to Financial Statements.

 

The effective tax rates
for 2016, 2015 and 2014 are lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35% primarily due to lower tax rates on non-U.S. earnings, the
vast majority of which we intend to permanently reinvest outside the United States.

 

The Company currently
expects the effective tax rate for 2017 to be approximately 25%. The effective tax rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to
unusual or infrequently occurring items, the resolution of income tax audits, changes in tax laws or other items such as pension
mark-to-market adjustments and the tax impact from employee share-based payments.

Earnings per share of
common stock – assuming dilution increased in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily driven by increased pension and other postretirement
income, higher segment profit in Home and Building Technologies and Performance Materials and Technologies, the gain related to
the Honeywell Technology Solutions, Inc. divestiture, a decrease in the weighted average shares outstanding and the tax benefit
from adoption of the FASB’s accounting standard related to employee share-based payment accounting, partially offset by lower
segment profit in Aerospace and Safety and Productivity Solutions, increased pension mark-to-market expense and higher repositioning
and other charges.

 

Earnings per share of
common stock – assuming dilution increased in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily driven by increased segment profit in each
of our business segments and lower pension and other postretirement expense, partially offset by increased tax expense and lower
other income (principally due to the absence of a realized gain related to the prior year sale of marketable equity securities).

2016 compared with 2015

 

Aerospace sales decreased
primarily due to higher incentives to original equipment manufacturers (OEM Incentives), a decrease in organic sales volumes and
the Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. divestiture, which was partially offset by growth from acquisitions.

 



     
·
Commercial Original Equipment sales
decreased by 13% (decreased 12% organic) primarily due to higher OEM incentives and decreased demand from business and
general aviation original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), partially offset by higher shipments to air transport OEMs.     Consistent with broader aerospace industry trends, we expect the continuation of lower business and general
aviation OEM     sales volumes.

     
     
     

     
·
Commercial Aftermarket sales increased by 3% (increased 3% organic) primarily driven by higher repair and overhaul activities and increased spares shipments.

     
     
     

     
·
Defense and Space sales decreased by 7% (decreased 6% organic) primarily due to declines in U.S. space and international defense programs, lower U.S. government services revenue, largely attributable to the impact of divestitures, and decreased demand from commercial helicopter OEMs, partially offset by sales from acquisitions.

     
     
     

     
·
Transportation Systems sales increased by 3% (increased 4% organic) primarily driven by new platform launches and higher global turbo gas penetration.

 

Aerospace segment profit
decreased primarily due to a 6% decrease in operational segment profit and a 1% unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation.
The decrease in operational segment profit is primarily due to product mix, higher OEM incentives and lower sales volumes, partially
offset by productivity and price, net of inflation. Cost of products and services sold decreased primarily driven by productivity,
net of inflation, and lower sales volumes, partially offset by acquisitions, net of divestitures.

 

2015 compared with 2014

 

Aerospace sales decreased
primarily due to the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and the Friction Materials divestiture, partially offset
by an increase in organic sales, as discussed below, and a decrease in OEM incentives predominantly to air transport and regional
aviation OEMs.

 



     
·
Commercial Original Equipment sales increased by 11% (increased by 5% organic) primarily driven by a decrease in OEM Incentives and higher business and general aviation engine shipments.



21
    
    



     
·
Commercial Aftermarket sales increased by 2% (increased 2% organic) primarily driven by higher repair and overhaul activities, partially offset by lower retrofits, modifications and upgrades for business and general aviation customers.

     
     
     

     
·
Defense and Space sales decreased by 1% (flat organic) primarily due to lower U.S. government revenue, partially offset by growth in international programs.

     
     
     

     
·
Transportation Systems sales decreased by 19% (increased 3% organic) primarily due to the unfavorable impact from foreign currency translation and the Friction Materials divestiture, partially offset by continued growth from new platform launches and higher global turbo gas penetration.

 

Aerospace segment profit
increased primarily due to an 8% increase in operational segment profit and a 6% favorable impact of acquisitions, divestitures
and other (predominantly the absence of higher prior year OEM Incentives), as discussed above, partially offset by a 4% unfavorable
impact of foreign currency translation. The increase in operational segment profit is primarily driven by productivity, net of
inflation, and favorable pricing, partially offset by continued investments for growth. Cost of products and services sold decreased
primarily due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, the Friction Materials divestiture, and productivity, net
of inflation, partially offset by continued investments for growth.

Repositioning Charges

 

See Note 3 Repositioning
and Other Charges of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in
2016, 2015 and 2014. These repositioning actions are expected to generate incremental pretax savings of $200 million to $300 million
in 2017 compared with 2016 principally from planned workforce reductions. Cash spending related to our repositioning actions was
$228 million, $118 million and $161 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, and was funded through operating cash flows. In 2017, we expect
cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately $225 million and to be funded through operating cash flows.

 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

 

The Company continues
to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash
and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper
market, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. We continue to balance our cash and financing uses
through investment in our existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends.

2016 compared with 2015

 

Cash provided by operating
activities decreased by $21 million primarily due to a $958 million unfavorable impact from working capital, partially offset by
(i) a $395 million improvement in customer advances and deferred income, (ii) a $171 million increase in net income before the
non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment, (iii) the absence of $151 million in OEM incentive payments and (iv) lower cash tax
payments of $50 million.

 

Cash used for investing
activities decreased by $3,172 million primarily due to (i) a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $2,655 million, most significantly
Elster in 2015, (ii) an increase in proceeds from the sales of businesses of $295 million (most significantly Honeywell Technology
Solutions Inc.) and (iii) a $384 million favorable change in settlements of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic
hedges on certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The decreases were partially offset by a
net $146 million increase in investments, primarily short-term marketable securities.

 

Cash provided by financing
activities increased by $309 million primarily due to an increase in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $497 million, partially
offset by an increase in cash dividends paid of $189 million including amounts paid to the former UOP Russell LLC noncontrolling
shareholder.

 

2015 compared with 2014

 

Cash provided by operating
activities increased by $439 million primarily due to a $489 million favorable impact from working capital and a $382 million increase
in net income before the non-cash pension mark-to-market adjustment, partially offset by (i) a $175 million decrease in customer
advances and deferred income, (ii) $151 million in OEM incentives and (iii) increased cash tax payments of $50 million.

 

Cash used for investing
activities increased by $4,638 million primarily due to an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $5,224 million, most significantly
Elster, and a decrease in proceeds of $159 million, primarily from the Friction Materials divestiture, partially offset by a net
$659 million decrease in investments, primarily short-term marketable securities.

 

Cash provided by financing
activities increased by $2,365 million primarily due to an increase in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $3,648 million,
partially offset by an increase in net repurchases of common stock of $1,039 million and an increase in cash dividends paid of
$216 million.

 

Liquidity

 

Each of our businesses
is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working
capital turnover. Considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans
and strategies, including the focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, we believe that cash balances and
operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity. In addition to the available cash and operating cash
flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term
borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. At December 31, 2016, a substantial portion of the Company’s
cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. If the amounts held outside of the U.S. were to be repatriated, under
current law, they would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. However, our intent is to
permanently reinvest the vast majority of these funds outside of the U.S. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax
that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated, and the amount of foreign tax credits that would
be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability.



26
    
    

We monitor the third-party
depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily safety of principal
and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure
to any one of these entities.

 

A
source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at
a discount and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are
available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. The weighted
average interest rate on short-term borrowings and commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2016 was
(0.13%) and as of December 31, 2015 was 0.26%.

 

Our ability to access
the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market
conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2016,
Standard and Poor’s (S&P), Fitch, and Moody’s have ratings on our long-term debt of A, A and A2 and short-term
debt of A-1, F1 and P1. S&P, Fitch and Moody’s have Honeywell’s rating outlook as “stable.” To date,
the Company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity.

 

We also have a current
shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue additional debt securities,
common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering.
Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, share
repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisitions.

 

See Note 2 Acquisitions
and Divestitures and Note 12 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements of Notes to Financial Statements for additional discussion
of items impacting our liquidity.

 

In 2016, the Company
repurchased $2,079 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including
option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. In April 2016, the Board of Directors
authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $5 billion of Honeywell common stock, of which $4.1 billion remained available as
of December 31, 2016 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to
time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted
unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans.

 

In addition to our normal
operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, dividends, strategic
acquisitions, share repurchases, employee benefit obligations, environmental remediation costs, asbestos claims, severance and
exit costs related to repositioning actions and debt repayments.

 

Specifically, we expect
our primary cash requirements in 2017 to be as follows:

 


§Capital expenditures—we expect to spend
approximately $1.1 billion for capital expenditures in 2017 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, cost reduction,
maintenance, and replacement.

 


§Share repurchases— under the Company’s
share repurchase program, $4.1 billion is available as of December 31, 2016 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently
expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation
plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. The amount and timing
of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing and other investing activities.

 


§Dividends—we increased our quarterly
dividend rate by 12% to $.6650 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2016 dividend. The Company intends to
continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2017.

 


§Asbestos claims—we expect our cash
spending for asbestos claims and our cash receipts for related insurance recoveries to be approximately $546 million and $23 million
in 2017.

 


§Pension contributions—in 2017, we are
not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans. We plan to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities
of approximately $130 million ($89 million of marketable securities were contributed in January 2017) to our non-U.S. plans to



27
    
    

satisfy regulatory funding standards.
The timing and amount of contributions to both our U.S. and non-U.S. plans may be impacted by a number of factors, including the
funded status of the plans.

 


§Repositioning actions—we expect that
cash spending for severance and other exit costs necessary to execute repositioning actions will approximate $225 million in 2017.

 


§Environmental remediation costs—we
expect to spend approximately $250 million in 2017 for remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs.

 

We continuously assess
the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution
in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. We identify
acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses
that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These
businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints.
In 2016 and 2015, we realized $565 million and $1 million in cash proceeds from sales and a spin-off of non-strategic businesses.

 

Based on past performance
and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs.
Our available cash, committed credit lines and access to the public debt and equity markets, provide additional sources of short-term
and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities.

Environmental Matters

 

Accruals for environmental
matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $195 million, $194 million and $268 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014. In addition,
in 2016 and 2015 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $83 million and $90 million relating to compliance
with environmental regulations.

 

Spending related to known
environmental matters was $228 million, $273 million and $321 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014 and is estimated to be approximately
$250 million in 2017. We expect to fund expenditures for these environmental matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash
expenditures depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal
injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques
to be utilized and agreement with other parties.

 

See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies
of Notes to Financial Statements for further discussion of our environmental matters.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

 

The preparation of our
consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application
of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently
uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements.
Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated
financial statements.

 

Contingent Liabilities—We
are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out
of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial
transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit
plans, intellectual property, legal and environmental, health and safety matters. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse
judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability,
if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if
applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental
matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary
requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new
developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system),
changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements
for a discussion of management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities
which represent our most significant contingencies.

 

Asbestos Related
Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries—Honeywell’s involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions
relates to two predecessor companies. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrued
for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with NARCO, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants,
and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. We also accrued for the estimated
value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust. The estimate of future NARCO claims
is based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts and also reflects disputes
concerning implementation of the Trust Distribution Procedures by the NARCO Trust, a lack of sufficient trust claims processing
experience, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims which remained in place throughout NARCO’s Chapter 11 case.
Some critical assumptions underlying this commonly accepted methodology include claims filing rates, disease criteria and payment
values contained in the Trust Distribution Procedures, estimated approval rates of claims submitted to the NARCO Trust and epidemiological
studies estimating disease instances. The estimated value of future NARCO claims was originally established at the time of the
NARCO Chapter 11 filing reflecting claims expected to be asserted against NARCO over a fifteen year period. This projection resulted
in a range of estimated liability of $743 million to $961 million. We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate
than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range. Regarding Bendix asbestos related claims,
we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued
for the estimated value of future anticipated claims related to Bendix for the next five years based on historic claims filing
experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five
years. In light of the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product
asbestos claims, we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years.

 

In connection with the
recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable.
In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable
and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. While the
substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered
in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance
recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty
in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light of any changes
to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries.





30
    
    

See Note 19 Commitments
and Contingencies of Notes to Financial Statements for a discussion of management’s judgments applied in the recognition
and measurement of our asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries.

 

Defined Benefit
Pension Plans—We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For financial
reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions,
including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the discount
rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. Annual
pension (income) expense is comprised of a potential mark-to-market adjustment (MTM Adjustment) and service and interest cost,
assumed return on plan assets and prior service amortization (Pension Ongoing (Income) Expense).

 

The key assumptions used
in developing our 2016, 2015 and 2014 net periodic pension (income) expense for our U.S. plans included the following:

(1) N/A in 2015 and 2014 as the discount rate methodology was changed in fourth quarter of 2015. See Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Financial Statements.
    


 

The MTM Adjustment represents
the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of the corridor. Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual
experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. The primary
factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the
measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. The mark-to-market accounting
method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments. MTM charges were $273 million, $67 million
and $249 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014.

 

We determine the expected
long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our
expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of
Notes to Financial Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our
pension plans). We plan to continue to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 7.75% for 2017 as this is a long-term rate
based on historical plan asset returns over varying long term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions
and the asset mix of the plan’s investments.

 

The discount rate reflects
the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our
benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined
based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We used a 4.20% discount rate to determine benefit obligations
as of December 31, 2016, reflecting the decrease in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end.

 

In addition to the potential
for MTM Adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also
affects future pension ongoing (income) expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations
and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude
any potential MTM Adjustment:

Pension ongoing income
for all of our pension plans is expected to be approximately $715 million in 2017 compared with pension ongoing income of $601
million in 2016. The expected increase is primarily due to higher asset returns in 2016 and lower interest costs due to a decline
in discount rates, mainly in our U.S. and UK plans. Also, if required, an MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter
of 2017 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict
whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2017, and if one is required what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments
are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance
of the financial markets.

 

Long-Lived Assets
(including Tangible and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets)—The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization
purposes) and whether or not tangible and intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions,
changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates
and assumptions. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering
when to perform an impairment review are as follows:

 



     
•
Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations; 

     
     
     

     
•
Annual operating plans or five-year strategic plans that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line; 

     
     
     

     
•
Significant negative industry or economic trends; or 

     
     
     

     
•
Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets.

 

Once it is determined
that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping
to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the
asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the
asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually
either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash
flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumptions as to expected
industry growth rates, sales volume, selling prices and costs, and the discount rate selected. These estimates are subject to changes
in the economic environment, including market interest rates and expected volatility. Management believes the estimates of future
cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect
the valuations.

 

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived
Intangible Assets Impairment Testing— Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized,
but are subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing. In testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic
and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates
and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ
from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions.

 

Income Taxes—On
a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive
and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections





32
    
    

of future taxable income, enacted tax law
changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives. Our projections of future taxable income include a number of
estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary
differences.

 

Sales Recognition
on Long-Term Contracts—In 2016, we recognized approximately 13% of our total net sales using the percentage-of-completion
method for long-term contracts. These long-term contracts are measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts
and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Accounting for these contracts involves management judgment in estimating
total contract revenue and cost. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified
by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance
and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which
can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated
or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence
these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business
volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and
revised based on changes in circumstances. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident.
We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of
contract losses.

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(Dollars in millions, except per share
amounts) 

 

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Accounting Principles—The
financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. The following is a description of Honeywell’s significant accounting policies.

 

Principles of
Consolidation—The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all
of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained. Our consolidation policy requires equity investments
that we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s
activities to be accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence
over the investee and which we do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. All intercompany
transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.

 

Redeemable noncontrolling
interest is considered to be temporary equity and is therefore reported outside of permanent equity on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet at the greater of the initial carrying amount adjusted for the noncontrolling interest’s share of net income (loss)
or its redemption value.

 

Property, Plant
and Equipment—Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less
accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives
of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and 2 to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur
such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated
over the corresponding asset’s useful life.

 

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived
Intangible Assets—Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of
March 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This
testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value.
We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2016 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date.

 

Other Intangible
Assets with Determinable Lives—Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology,
patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 24 years.

 

Sales Recognition—Product
and service sales are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product delivery has occurred or services have
been rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Service sales, principally representing
repair, maintenance and engineering activities are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. Sales under
long-term contracts are recorded on a percentage-of-completion method measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts
and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded
in full when such losses become evident. Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements are recognized as each element
is earned based on the relative fair value of each element provided the delivered elements have value to customers on a standalone
basis. Amounts allocated to each element are based on its objectively determined fair value, such as the sales price for the product
or service when it is sold separately or competitor prices for similar products or services.

 

Environmental—We
accrue costs related to environmental matters when it is probable that we have incurred a liability related to a contaminated site
and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies.

 

Asbestos Related
Contingencies and Insurance Recoveries—We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable
of occurrence and reasonably estimable. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record
asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies.

 

Aerospace Sales
Incentives—We provide sales incentives to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines in connection with their
selection of our aircraft equipment, predominately wheel and braking system hardware, avionics, and auxiliary power units, for
installation on commercial aircraft. These incentives consist of

(Dollars in millions, except per share
amounts) 

 


free or deeply discounted products, credits for future
purchases of product and upfront cash payments. These costs are recognized in the period incurred as cost of products sold or
as a reduction to sales, as appropriate.

 

Research and Development—Research
and development costs for company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred. Such costs are principally
included in cost of products sold and were $2,143 million, $1,856 million and $1,892 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014.

 

Stock-Based Compensation
Plans—The principal awards issued under our stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 18 Stock-Based
Compensation Plans, are non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units. The cost for such awards is measured at the grant
date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized
as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in selling, general
and administrative expenses. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant to recognize expense for those awards that are expected
to vest and are based on our historical forfeiture rates.

 

Pension
Benefits—We recognize net actuarial gains or losses
in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation (the corridor)
annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment), and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim remeasurement
is triggered. The remaining components of pension (income) expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on
plan assets, are recognized on a quarterly basis (Pension ongoing (income) expense).

 

Foreign Currency
Translation— Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency
other than U.S. Dollars are translated into U.S. Dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales, costs and expenses are translated
at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component
of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and
property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets
were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these
subsidiaries are included in earnings.

 

Derivative Financial
Instruments— We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through our normal
operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative
financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use leveraged
derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting must be designated and effective
as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative
contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over
the life of the hedge contract.

 

All derivatives are
recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the
fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current
earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives
are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact
earnings. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item.

 

Income Taxes—
Significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional reserves for income taxes when, despite
the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold.
The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when
a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course
of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly
assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining
the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust
the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change
in estimate become known.

Cash and cash equivalents—
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less.



 

Earnings Per Share—Basic
earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding.

 

Reclassifications—Certain
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

 

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements—We consider the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs). ASUs not listed
below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated results
of operations, financial position and cash flows (consolidated financial statements).

 

In May 2014, the FASB
issued guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including
industry-specific guidance. The underlying principle is that an entity will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or
services to customers at an amount that the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance
provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. Other major provisions include capitalization
of certain contract costs, consideration of time value of money in the transaction price, and allowing estimates of variable consideration
to be recognized before contingencies are resolved in certain circumstances. The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding
the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts with customers. The
effective date was deferred for one year to the interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. Early adoption
is permitted as of the original effective date – interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016. The
guidance permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have not yet selected a transition
method.

 

We are still finalizing
the analysis to quantify the adoption impact of the provisions of the new standard, but we do not currently expect it to have a
material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Based on the evaluation of our current contracts
and revenue streams, most will be recorded consistently under both the current and new standard. The FASB has issued, and may issue
in the future, interpretive guidance which may cause our evaluation to change. We believe we are following an appropriate timeline
to allow for proper recognition, presentation and disclosure upon adoption effective the beginning of fiscal year 2018.

 

In February 2016, the
FASB issued guidance on accounting for leases which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights
and obligations created by those leases. The guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding the amount, timing, and uncertainty
of cash flows arising from leases that will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early
adoption is permitted. The guidance requires the use of a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating the impact
of the guidance on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and related notes to financial statements.

 

In March 2016, the FASB
issued amended guidance related to the employee share-based payment accounting. The guidance requires all income tax effect of
awards to be recognized in the income statement, which were previously presented as a component of Total shareowners’ equity,
on a prospective basis. The guidance also requires presentation of excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement
of cash flows rather than as a financing activity. We have elected to early adopt the standard in the quarter ended September
30, 2016, which requires adoption effective as of the beginning of the fiscal year. The adoption resulted in a diluted earnings
per share benefit of $0.14 and the recognition of excess tax benefits as a reduction in the provision for income taxes of $127
million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Refer to Note 24 Unaudited Quarterly Financial Information for the earnings per
share for the first and second quarters of 2016, recast to reflect the impact from adoption. Cash paid by the Company when directly
withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes are classified as a financing activity on a retrospective basis.

The guidance allows for
an accounting policy election to estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur.
We elected to maintain the current forfeitures policy and will continue to include an estimate of those forfeitures when recognizing
stock compensation expense. Classification of the excess tax benefits in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows are presented
on a prospective basis as of January 1, 2016.

 

In August 2016, the FASB
issued new guidance intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and payments are classified in the statement
of cash flows, including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, the settlement of contingent liabilities arising from a business
combination, proceeds from insurance settlements, and distributions from certain equity method investees. The guidance is effective
for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and early adoption is permitted. The guidance requires application
on a retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance.

 

In October 2016, the
FASB issued an accounting standard update which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity
transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Under current GAAP, recognition of the income tax consequences
for asset transfers other than inventory could not be recognized until the asset was sold to a third party. The guidance is intended
to reduce diversity in practice related to the tax consequences of certain types of intra-entity asset transfers, particularly
those involving intellectual property. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017,
and early adoption is permitted. The guidance requires application on a modified retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating
the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statements.

 



Note 2. Acquisitions and Divestitures

 

During 2016 and 2015,
we acquired businesses for an aggregate cost (net of cash and debt assumed) of $2,538 million and $5,244 million.

 


In August 2016, the Company
acquired Intelligrated, a leading provider of supply chain and warehouse automation technologies, for an aggregate value, net of
cash acquired, of $1,488 million. Intelligrated is part of Safety and Productivity Solutions. The preliminary determination of
the assets and liabilities acquired with Intelligrated have been included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31,
2016, including $1,129 million allocated to goodwill, which is non-deductible for tax purposes.



 

In April 2016, the Company
completed the acquisition of Xtralis International Holdings Limited (Xtralis), a leading global provider of aspiration smoke detection
and perimeter security technologies, for an aggregate cost, net of cash acquired and debt assumed, of $515 million. Xtralis is
part of Home and Building Technologies.


 

In February 2016, the
Company acquired 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of COM DEV International (COM DEV), a leading satellite and space
components provider, for an aggregate value, net of cash acquired and debt assumed, of $347 million. COM DEV is part of Aerospace
and had reported 2015 fiscal year revenues of $159 million.


 

In
January 2016, the Company acquired the remaining 30 percent noncontrolling interest in UOP Russell LLC, which develops technology
and manufactures modular equipment to process natural gas, for $240 million. UOP Russell LLC is part of Performance Materials and
Technologies.



 

In December 2015, the
Company completed the acquisition of the Elster Division of Melrose Industries plc (Elster), for an aggregate value, net of cash
acquired, of $4,899 million. Elster had 2015 revenues of $1,670 million and has been integrated into Home and Building Technologies

The Elster identifiable
intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, trade names and technology that are being amortized over their estimated
lives ranging from 1 to 20 years using straight line and accelerated amortization methods. The goodwill is non-deductible for
tax purposes.

 

As of December 31, 2016,
the purchase accounting for Intelligrated, Xtralis and COM DEV is subject to final adjustment, primarily for the valuation of
amounts allocated to intangible assets and goodwill, determination of useful lives for definite-lived intangible assets, tax balances
and for any pre-acquisition contingencies. Goodwill arising from these acquisitions is non-deductible for tax purposes. The results
of operations from date of acquisition through December 31, 2016 are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

 

On October 1, 2016,
the Company completed the tax-free spin-off of its Resins and Chemicals business, part of Performance Materials and Technologies,
into a standalone, publicly-traded company (named AdvanSix Inc. or AdvanSix) to Honeywell shareowners. The assets and liabilities
associated with AdvanSix have been removed from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The results of operations for
AdvanSix are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations through the effective date of the spin-off.

 

Honeywell shareowners
of record as of the close of business on September 16, 2016 received one share of AdvanSix common stock for every 25 shares of
Honeywell common stock. Immediately prior to the effective date of the spin-off, AdvanSix incurred debt to make a cash distribution
of $269 million to the Company. At the same time, AdvanSix also incurred $38 million of borrowings in order to fund its post spin-off
working capital.

 

The Company entered
into certain agreements with AdvanSix to effect our legal and structural separation including a transition services agreement
with AdvanSix to provide certain administrative and other services for a limited time.

 

On September 16, 2016,
the Company completed the sale of Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. for a sale price of $300 million. The Company recognized
a pre-tax gain of $176 million, which was recorded in Other (income) expense. The Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. business
was part of Aerospace.

In 2016, we recognized
repositioning charges totaling $369 million including severance costs of $283 million related to workforce reductions of 6,585
manufacturing and administrative positions across our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings
actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives; the separation of the former
Automation and Control Solutions reporting segment into two new reporting segments; factory transitions in each of our reportable
operating segments to more cost-effective locations; and achieving acquisition-related synergies. The repositioning charge included
asset impairments of $43 million principally related to the write-off of certain intangible assets in connection with the sale
of a Performance Materials and Technologies business. The repositioning charge included exit costs of $43 million principally for
expenses related to the spin-off of our AdvanSix business and closure obligations associated with factory transitions. Also, $109
million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, were returned to income as a result of higher attrition than
anticipated in prior severance programs resulting in lower required severance payments, lower than expected severance costs in
certain repositioning actions, and changes in scope of previously announced repositioning actions.

In 2015, we recognized
repositioning charges totaling $216 million including severance costs of $197 million related to workforce reductions of 6,405
manufacturing and administrative positions across our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings
actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives. Also, $53 million of previously
established accruals, primarily for severance, were returned to income due principally to higher attrition than anticipated in
prior severance programs resulting in lower required severance payments, and changes in scope of previously announced repositioning
actions.

 

In 2014, we recognized
repositioning charges totaling $184 million including severance costs of $156 million related to workforce reductions of 2,975
manufacturing and administrative positions across our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings
actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives; factory transitions in Home
and Building Technologies, Safety and Productivity Solutions and Aerospace to more cost-effective locations; and site consolidations
and organizational realignments of businesses in Home and Building Technologies, Safety and Productivity Solutions and Performance
Materials and Technologies. Also, $38 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, were returned to income
due principally to the change in scope of a previously announced repositioning action and higher attrition than anticipated in
prior severance programs resulting in lower required severance payments.

The effective tax
rate decreased by 1.6 percentage points in 2016 compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to excess tax
benefits from employee share-based payments arising from adoption of the FASB’s amended guidance related to employee
share-based payment accounting, partially offset by increased tax reserves in various jurisdictions and lower tax benefits
from manufacturing incentives. The Company’s non-U.S. effective tax rate was 16.7%, a decrease of approximately 2.8
percentage points compared to 2015. The year-over-year decrease in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily driven by
higher earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and a decrease in the tax impact of restructuring and divestitures. The
effective tax rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to overall non-U.S. earnings taxed at
lower rates.

 

The effective tax rate
increased by 0.8 percentage points in 2015 compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to decreased tax benefits
from the resolution of tax audits, partially offset by increased tax benefits from manufacturing incentives, the impact of more
income in jurisdictions with lower tax rates and fewer reserves. The Company’s non-U.S. effective tax rate for 2015 was 19.5%,
a decrease of approximately 1.8 percentage points compared to 2014. The year-over-year decrease in the non-U.S. effective tax rate
was primarily attributable to higher earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions coupled with lower expense related to reserves in
various jurisdictions, partially offset by an increase from the tax impact of restructuring and dispositions. The effective tax
rate was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to overall non-U.S. earnings taxed at lower rates.

The change in deferred
tax balance was primarily attributable to deferred tax liabilities transferred in connection with the AdvanSix spin-off. Our gross
deferred tax assets include $1,034 million related to non-U.S. operations comprised principally of net operating losses, capital
loss and tax credit carryforwards (mainly in Canada, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom) and deductible temporary
differences. We maintain a valuation allowance of $619 million against a portion of the non-U.S. gross deferred tax assets. The
change in the valuation allowance resulted in an increase of $69 million, increase of $114 million and decrease of $10 million
to income tax expense in 2016, 2015 and 2014. In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax
assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through an increase to income tax expense in the period such determination is
made. Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we
will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a reduction to income tax expense in the period that such determination
is made.

 

As of December 31, 2016,
our net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards were as follows:

Many jurisdictions impose

is an expected permanent limitation on the utilization of the net operating loss or tax credit carryforward the deferred tax asset
and amount of the carryforward have been reduced.

 

U.S. federal income taxes
have not been provided on undistributed earnings of the vast majority of our international subsidiaries as it is our intention

December 31, 2016 Honeywell has not provided
for U.S. federal income and non-U.S. withholding taxes on approximately $18.3 billion of such earnings of our non-U.S. operations.
It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if some or all of such earnings were to be repatriated,
and the amount of foreign tax credits that would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting U.S. income tax liability.

Based on the outcome
of these examinations, or as a result of the expiration of statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably
possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns will materially change
from those recorded as liabilities in our financial statements. In addition, the outcome of these examinations may impact the valuation
of certain deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses) in future periods.

 

Unrecognized tax benefits
for examinations in progress were $398 million, $349 million and $403 million, as of December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014. Estimated
interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes are classified as a component of Tax Expense in the Consolidated
Statement of Operations and totaled $18 million, $11 million and $24 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.
Accrued interest and penalties were $395 million, $336 million and $325 million, as of December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014.

Note 14. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures

 

Credit and Market
Risk—Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to
market risk related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through
specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk.
Our counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using
such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other
financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates and restrict the use
of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities.

 

We continually monitor
the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions
of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are
not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers.

 

Foreign Currency
Risk Management—We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure
to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries,
foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade. Our primary objective
is to preserve the U.S. Dollar value of foreign currency denominated cash flows and earnings. We attempt to hedge currency exposures
with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency
exchange forward and option contracts (foreign currency exchange contracts) with third parties.

 

We hedge monetary assets
and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Prior to conversion into U.S. dollars, these assets and liabilities are
remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings
and included in other (income) expense. We partially hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which occur in the next twelve months
and are denominated in non-functional currencies, with foreign currency exchange contracts. Changes in the forecasted non-functional
currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the foreign currency
exchange contracts designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged
transaction is recognized. Open foreign currency exchange contracts mature in the next twelve months. At December 31, 2016 and
2015, we had contracts with notional amounts of $9,554 million and $10,538 million to exchange foreign currencies, principally
the U.S. Dollar, Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi, Indian Rupee, Mexican Peso, Singapore Dollar, U.A.E. Dirham
and Swiss Franc.

 

We have also
designated foreign currency debt as hedges against portions of our net investment in foreign operations during the year ended
December 31, 2016. Gains or losses on the effective portion of the foreign currency debt designated as a net investment hedge
are recorded in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments. The Company did not have ineffectiveness related
to net investment hedges during the year ended December 31, 2016.

Interest Rate Risk
Management—We use a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term and short-term financing,
variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related
overall cost of borrowing. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively
changed $1,850 million and $1,100 million of fixed rate debt at rates of 3.39% and 4.00% to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Our interest
rate swaps mature at various dates through 2026.

 

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments—The FASB’s accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price).

 

Financial and nonfinancial
assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
measurement. The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair
value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:

The foreign currency
exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed
or over-the-counter markets. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2. The Company also holds investments
in commercial paper, certificates of deposits, and time deposits that are designated as available for sale and are valued using
published prices based off observable market data. As such, these investments are classified within level 2.

 

The carrying value of
cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables, commercial paper and short-term borrowings contained
in the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value. The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets
and liabilities that were not carried at fair value:

The Company determined
the fair value of the long-term receivables by discounting based upon the terms of the receivable and counterparty details including
credit quality. As such, the fair value of these receivables is considered level 2. The Company determined the fair value of the
long-term debt and related current maturities utilizing transactions in the listed markets for identical or similar liabilities.
As such, the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities is considered level 2 as well.

 

Interest rate swap agreements
are designated as hedge relationships with gains or losses on the derivative recognized in interest and other financial charges
offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying debt

being hedged. Losses on interest rate swap
agreements recognized in earnings were $71 million and $2 million in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Gains on interest
rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $38 million in the year ended December 31, 2014. Gains and losses are fully offset
by losses and gains on the underlying debt being hedged.

 

We also economically
hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally with forward contracts. These contracts are marked-to-market
with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated
monetary assets and liabilities being hedged. We recognized $232 million of income in other (income) expense in the year ended
December 31, 2016. We recognize $86 million and $181 million of expense in other (income) expense in the years ended December 31,
2015 and 2014. See Note 4 Other (Income) Expense for further details of the net impact of these economic foreign currency hedges.

authorized the repurchase of up to $5 billion of Honeywell common stock and $2.2 billion remained available as of December 31,
2015.

 

We purchased approximately
19.3 million and 18.8 million shares of our common stock in 2016 and 2015, for $2,079 million and $1,884 million.

 

We are authorized to

Note 18. Stock-Based Compensation Plans

 

The 2016 Stock Incentive
Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (2016 Plan) and 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell
International Inc. (2016 Directors Plan) were both approved by the shareowners at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners effective on
April 25, 2016. Following approval of both plans, we have not and will not grant any new awards under any previously existing stock-based
compensation plans. At December 31, 2016, there were 46,365,609, and 960,609 shares of Honeywell common stock available for future
grants under terms of the 2016 Plan and 2016 Directors Plan, respectively.

 

Stock Options—The
exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to each option granted under our stock plans are generally determined by the
Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and
may not be less than the fair market value per share of our stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an expense over
the employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). Options generally vest over a four-year
period and expire after ten years.

 

The fair value of each option
award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities
from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock. We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to
derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. Such model uses historical
data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual
life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

 

Compensation cost on a pre-tax
basis related to stock options recognized in selling, general and administrative expenses in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $87 million,
$78 million and $85 million. The associated future income tax benefit recognized in 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $29 million, $26 million
and $31 million.

 

The following table sets
forth fair value per share information, including related weighted-average assumptions, used to determine compensation cost:

over a weighted-average period of 2.29 years. The total fair value of options vested during 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $76 million,
$73 million and $72 million.

 

Restricted Stock Units—Restricted
stock unit (RSU) awards entitle the holder to receive one share of common stock for each unit when the units vest. RSUs are issued
to certain key employees and directors as compensation at fair market value at the date of grant. RSUs typically become fully vested
over periods ranging from three to seven years and are payable in Honeywell common stock upon vesting.

Note 19. Commitments and Contingencies

 

Environmental Matters

 

We are subject to various
federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a
general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage
and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental
and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other
companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and
are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing
hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in
the future.

 

With respect to environmental
matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible
parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques. It is our policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental
matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities
are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities
are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available.
Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible
parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the
range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED)

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

 

our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund
expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including
the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability,
personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements
with other parties.

 

The following table summarizes information concerning
our recorded liabilities for environmental costs:

We do not currently possess
sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of
studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters
can be determined although they could be material to our consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods
recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters
will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.

 

Onondaga Lake, Syracuse,
NY—In 2016, we largely completed a dredging/capping remedy of Onondaga Lake pursuant to a consent decree approved
by the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York in January 2007. Some additional long-term monitoring
and maintenance activities will continue, as required by the consent decree. Honeywell is also conducting remedial investigations
and activities at other sites in Syracuse. We have recorded reserves for these investigations and activities where appropriate,
consistent with the accounting policy described above.

 

Honeywell has entered into
a cooperative agreement with potential natural resource trustees to assess alleged natural resource damages relating to this site.
It is not possible to predict the outcome or duration of this assessment, or the amounts of, or responsibility for, any damages.

 

Asbestos Matters

 

Honeywell is a defendant
in asbestos related personal injury actions related to two predecessor companies:

 


·North American Refractories Company (NARCO),
which was sold in 1986, produced refractory products (bricks and cement used in high temperature applications). Claimants consist
largely of individuals who allege exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing refractory products in an occupational setting.

 


·Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix) business,
which was sold in 2014, manufactured automotive brake parts that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form. Claimants
consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to asbestos from brakes from either performing or being in the vicinity of individuals
who performed brake replacements.

NARCO Products
–In connection with NARCO’s emergence from bankruptcy on April 30, 2013, a federally authorized 524(g) trust (NARCO
Trust) was established for the evaluation and resolution of all existing



65
    
    


HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – (CONTINUED)

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

 

and future NARCO asbestos claims. Both Honeywell
and NARCO are protected by a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal
courts and requiring all asbestos related claims based on exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products to be made against the
NARCO Trust. The NARCO Trust reviews submitted claims and determines award amounts in accordance with established Trust Distribution
Procedures approved by the Bankruptcy Court which set forth the criteria claimants must meet to qualify for compensation including,
among other things, exposure and medical criteria that determine the award amount. In addition, Honeywell provided, and continues
to provide, input to the design of control procedures for processing NARCO claims, and has on-going audit rights to review and
monitor the claims processors’ adherence to the established requirements of the Trust Distribution Procedures.

 

Honeywell is
obligated to fund NARCO asbestos claims submitted to the NARCO Trust which qualify for payment under the Trust Distribution
Procedures (Annual Contribution Claims), subject to annual caps of $140 million in the years 2017 and 2018 and $145 million
for each year thereafter. However, the initial $100 million of claims processed through the NARCO Trust (the Initial Claims
Amount) will not count against the annual cap and any unused portion of the Initial Claims Amount will roll over to
subsequent years until fully utilized. In 2015, Honeywell filed suit against the NARCO Trust in Bankruptcy Court alleging
breach of certain provisions of the Trust Agreement and Trust Distribution Procedures. The parties agreed to dismiss the
proceeding without prejudice pursuant to an 18 month Standstill Agreement that expires in October 2017. Claims processing will
continue during this period subject to a defined dispute resolution process. As of December 31, 2016, Honeywell has not made
any payments to the NARCO Trust for Annual Contribution Claims.

 

Honeywell is also responsible
for payments due to claimants pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings
that provide for the right to submit claims to the NARCO Trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements
and Trust Distribution Procedures criteria (Pre-established Unliquidated Claims), which amounts are estimated at $150 million and
are expected to be paid during the initial years of trust operations ($5 million of which has been paid since the effective date
of the NARCO Trust). Such payments are not subject to the annual cap described above.

 

Our consolidated financial
statements reflect an estimated liability for pre-established unliquidated claims ($145 million), unsettled claims pending as of
the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection ($31 million) and for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos claims expected
to be asserted against the NARCO Trust ($743 million). The estimate of future NARCO claims is based on a commonly accepted methodology
used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts and also reflects disputes concerning implementation of the Trust Distribution
Procedures by the NARCO Trust, a lack of sufficient trust claims processing experience, as well as the stay of all NARCO asbestos
claims which remained in place throughout NARCO’s Chapter 11 case. Some critical assumptions underlying this commonly accepted
methodology include claims filing rates, disease criteria and payment values contained in the Trust Distribution Procedures, estimated
approval rates of claims submitted to the NARCO Trust and epidemiological studies estimating disease instances. The estimated value
of future NARCO claims was originally established at the time of the NARCO Chapter 11 filing reflecting claims expected to be asserted
against NARCO over a fifteen year period. This projection resulted in a range of estimated liability of $743 million to $961 million.
We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum
amount in the range.

 

Our insurance receivable
corresponding to the estimated liability for pending and future NARCO asbestos claims reflects coverage which reimburses Honeywell
for portions of NARCO-related indemnity and defense costs and is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens
of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. We conduct analyses to estimate the
probable amount of insurance that is recoverable for asbestos claims. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers
are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. We
made judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our
knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers.

 

Projecting future events
is subject to many uncertainties that could cause the NARCO-related asbestos liabilities or assets to be higher or lower than those
projected and recorded. Given the uncertainties, we review our estimates periodically, and update them based on our experience
and other relevant factors. Similarly, we will reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries in light
of any changes to the projected liability or other developments that may impact insurance recoveries.

It is not possible to predict
whether resolution values for Bendix-related asbestos claims will increase, decrease or stabilize in the future.

 

Our consolidated financial
statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of pending (claims actually filed as of the financial statement date)
and future Bendix-related asbestos claims. We have valued Bendix pending and future claims using average resolution values for
the previous five years. We update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix pending and future claims during the
fourth quarter each year.

 

The liability for future
claims represents the estimated value of future asbestos related bodily injury claims expected to be asserted against Bendix over
the next five years. Such estimated cost of future Bendix-related asbestos claims is based on historic claims filing experience
and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In light of
the uncertainties inherent in making long-term projections, as well as certain factors unique to friction product asbestos claims,
we do not believe that we have a reasonable basis for estimating asbestos claims beyond the next five years. The methodology used
to estimate the liability for future claims is similar to that used to estimate the liability for future NARCO-related asbestos
claims.

 

Our insurance receivable
corresponding to the liability for settlement of pending and future Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided
by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the
London excess market. Based on our ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the
financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims. This determination
is based on our analysis of the underlying insurance policies, our historical experience with our insurers, our ongoing review
of the solvency of our insurers, judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs, and our consideration of the impacts
of any settlements reached with our insurers.

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

(Dollars in millions, except per share amounts)

 

Honeywell
believes it has sufficient insurance coverage and reserves to cover all pending Bendix-related asbestos claims and Bendix-related
asbestos claims estimated to be filed within the next five years. Although it is impossible to predict the outcome of either pending
or future Bendix-related asbestos claims, we do not believe that such claims would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated
financial position in light of our insurance coverage and our prior experience in resolving such claims. If the rate and types
of claims filed, the average resolution value of such claims and the period of time over which claim settlements are paid (collectively,
the Variable Claims Factors) do not substantially change, Honeywell would not expect future Bendix-related asbestos claims to have
a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in any fiscal year. No assurances can be given,
however, that the Variable Claims Factors will not change.

 

Other Matters

 

We are subject to a number
of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of
our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions
and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability
for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments
of outcomes in these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries),
based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Included
in these other matters are the following:

 

Honeywell
v. United Auto Workers (UAW) et. al—In July 2011, Honeywell filed an action in federal court (District of New Jersey)
against the UAW and all former employees who retired under a series of Master Collective Bargaining Agreements (MCBAs) between
Honeywell and the UAW seeking a declaratory judgment that certain express limitations on its obligation to contribute toward the
healthcare coverage of such retirees (the CAPS) set forth in the MCBAs may be implemented, effective January 1, 2012. The UAW and
certain retiree defendants filed a mirror suit in the Eastern District of Michigan alleging that the MCBAs do not provide for CAPS
on the Company’s liability for healthcare coverage. The New Jersey action was dismissed and Honeywell subsequently answered
the UAW’s complaint in Michigan and asserted counterclaims for fraudulent inducement, negligent misrepresentation and breach
of implied warranty. The UAW filed a motion to dismiss these counterclaims. The court dismissed Honeywell’s fraudulent inducement
and negligent misrepresentation claims, but let stand the claim for breach of implied warranty. In the second quarter of 2014,
the parties agreed to stay the proceedings with respect to those retirees who retired before the initial inclusions of the CAPS
in the 2003 MCBA until the Supreme Court decided the M&G Polymers USA, LLC v. Tackett case.
In a ruling on January 26, 2015, the Supreme Court held that retiree health insurance benefits provided in collective bargaining
agreements do not carry an inference that they are vested or guaranteed to continue for life and that the “vesting”
issue must be decided pursuant to ordinary principles of contract law. The stay of the proceedings has been lifted and the case
is again proceeding. Based on the Supreme Court’s ruling, Honeywell is confident that the CAPS will be upheld and that its
liability for healthcare coverage premiums with respect to the putative class will be limited as negotiated and expressly set forth
in the applicable MCBAs. In the event of an adverse ruling, however, Honeywell’s other postretirement benefits for pre-2003
retirees would increase by approximately $129 million, reflecting the estimated value of these CAPS.

 

In December 2013, the UAW
and certain of the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment with respect to those retirees who retired after the
initial inclusion of the CAPS in the 2003 MCBA. The UAW sought a ruling that the 2003 MCBA did not limit Honeywell’s obligation
to contribute to healthcare coverage for the post-2003 retirees. That motion remains pending. Honeywell is confident that the Court
will find that the 2003 MCBA does, in fact, limit Honeywell’s retiree healthcare obligation for post-2003 retirees. In the
event of an adverse ruling, however, Honeywell’s other postretirement benefits for post-2003 retirees would increase by approximately
$95 million, reflecting the estimated value of these CAPS.

 

Joint Strike Fighter
Investigation - In 2013 the Company received subpoenas from the Department of Justice requesting information relating primarily
to parts manufactured in the United Kingdom and China used in the F-35 fighter jet. The Company is cooperating fully with the investigation.
While we believe that Honeywell has complied with all relevant U.S. laws and regulations regarding the manufacture of these sensors,
it is not possible

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

to predict the outcome of the investigation
or what action, if any, may result from it.

 

Given the uncertainty inherent
in litigation and investigations (including the specific matters referenced above), we do not believe it is possible to develop
estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above).
Considering our past experience and existing accruals, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in
the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved
over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy
or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable
remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized
or paid.

 

Warranties and Guarantees

 

In the normal course of business
we issue product warranties and product performance guarantees. We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranties and performance
guarantees based on contract terms and historical experience at the time of sale. Adjustments to initial obligations for warranties
and guarantees are made as changes to the obligations become reasonably estimable. The following table summarizes information concerning

Note 20. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

 

We sponsor both funded and
unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans covering the majority of our employees and retirees. Pension benefits
for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union
hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in
Honeywell’s U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees
who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans
outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate.

 

We also sponsor postretirement
benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywell’s
U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, more than 80% of Honeywell’s U.S.
retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact
of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid
from our operating cash flow.

The discount rate for
our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefits plans reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be
settled at the measurement date of December 31. To determine discount rates for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit
plans, we use a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans to a yield curve constructed
from a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments. We use the single weighted-average yield of this hypothetical
portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower
principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations.

 

During the fourth quarter
of 2015 we changed the methodology used to estimate the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit (income) cost
for our significant pension plans. Previously, we estimated such cost components utilizing a single weighted-average discount rate
derived from the yield curve used to measure the pension benefit obligation. The new methodology utilizes a full yield curve approach
in the estimation of these cost components by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination
of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and
interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. The change did not
affect the measurement of our pension obligation and was applied prospectively as a change in estimate. For our U.S. pension plans,
the single weighted average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs for 2017 are 4.42% and 3.49%.

 

Our expected rate of
return on U.S. plan assets of 7.75% is a long-term rate based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined
with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations. We review the expected rate of return on an annual basis and
revise it as appropriate.

 

For non-U.S. benefit
plans actuarial assumptions reflect economic and market factors relevant to each country.

Included in the aggregate
data in the tables above are the amounts applicable to our pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair
value of plan assets. Amounts related to such plans were as follows:

were $6.4 billion and $6.2 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015.

 

Our asset investment
strategy for our U.S. pension plans focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve
our long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis. Our

actual invested positions in various securities
change over time based on short and longer-term investment opportunities. To achieve our objectives, we have established long-term
target allocations as follows: 60%-70% equity securities, 10%-20% fixed income securities and cash, 5%-15% real estate investments,
and 10%-20% other types of investments. Equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located both inside and outside
the United States. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities,
and U.S. Treasuries. Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate
funds. Other types of investments include investments in private equity and hedge funds that follow several different strategies.
We review our assets on a regular basis to ensure that we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset
balances are adjusted back within target allocations.

 

Our non-U.S. pension
assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees with the Honeywell Corporate Investments group providing funding
and investment guidance. Our non-U.S. investment policies are different for each country as local regulations, funding requirements,
and financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country.

 

In accordance with ASU
2015-07, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)”, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset
value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value
amounts presented in the following tables are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented
for the total pension benefits plan assets.

 

The fair values of both
our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans assets by asset category are as follows:

The Company enters into
futures contracts to gain exposure to certain markets. Sufficient cash or cash equivalents are held by our pension plans to cover
the notional value of the futures contracts. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts
of $3,775 million and $2,613 million. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of
$55 million and $54 million. In both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is primarily related
to outstanding equity futures contracts.

 

Common stocks, preferred
stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market
in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds, mortgages, asset-backed securities, and government securities are
valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics
or discounted cash flows and as such include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity
risks. Certain securities are held in collective trust funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators
of the funds. Investments in private equity, debt, real estate and hedge funds and direct private investments are valued at estimated
fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. Investments in
real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach. Valuation estimates are periodically supplemented
by third party appraisals.

 

Our general funding
policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards.
In 2016, 2015 and 2014, we were not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans and no contributions were made. We
are not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans in 2017. In 2016, contributions of $149 million were made
to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements. In 2017, we expect to make contributions of cash and/or
marketable securities of approximately $130 million to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. Contributions
for both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans do not reflect benefits paid directly from Company assets.

 

Benefit payments, including
amounts to be paid from Company assets, and reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:

Note 21. Segment Financial Data

 

We globally manage our
business operations through four reportable operating segments. Segment information is consistent with how management reviews the
businesses, makes investing and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance.

 

Honeywell’s senior
management evaluates segment performance based on segment profit. Segment profit is measured as business unit income (loss) before
taxes excluding general corporate unallocated expense, other income (expense), interest and other financial charges, pension and
other postretirement benefits (expense), stock compensation expense and repositioning and other charges.

 

In July 2016, the Company
announced the realignment of the business units comprising its Automation and Control Solutions
reporting segment by forming two new reportable operating segments: Home and Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity
Solutions.  Home and Building Technologies includes Environmental & Energy Solutions, Security and Fire, and Building
Solutions and Distribution. Additionally, the Industrial Combustion/Thermal business, previously part of Environmental & Energy
Solutions in Automation and Control Solutions, became part of Performance Materials and Technologies. Safety
and Productivity Solutions includes

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS –

(Dollars in millions,
except per share amounts)

 


Sensing & Productivity Solutions and
Industrial Safety, as well as the Intelligrated business. Under the realigned segment reporting
structure, the Company’s reportable operating segments are Aerospace, Home and Building Technologies, Performance Materials
and Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions.

 

These realignments have
no impact on the Company’s historical consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Prior period
amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period segment presentation.

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm

 

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Honeywell International
Inc.

Morris Plains, New Jersey:

 

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of Honeywell International Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows and shareowners’ equity for the years
then ended. We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 based on
the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is
responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

 

We conducted our audits in accordance with
the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our
audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal
control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.
We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

 

A company’s internal control over
financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management,
and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance
that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

 

Because of the inherent limitations of internal
control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material
misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of
the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

 

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Honeywell International Inc. and
subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for the years then ended
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company
maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.


83
    
    


As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements, the Company has changed its method of accounting for employee share-based payments in 2016 and 2015 due to
the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation—Stock
Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm

 

To The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Honeywell International
Inc.:

 

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated
statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2014
present fairly, in all material respects, the results of operations and cash flows of Honeywell International Inc. and its subsidiaries
for the year ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements based on our audit. We conducted our audit of these financial statements in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements
with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

 

Not Applicable.

 

Item 9A. Controls and Procedures

 

Honeywell management
maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There have been no changes
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Honeywell’s internal control over financial
reporting that have occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2016.

 

Our management, with
the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) at December 31, 2016. Based on these evaluations, our CEO and CFO concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 were effective as of December
31, 2016.

 

Management’s Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

 

Honeywell management
is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

 

Because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

 

Management assessed
the effectiveness of Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this assessment,
management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal
Control – Integrated Framework (2013).

 

Based on this assessment,
management determined that Honeywell maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.

 

The effectiveness of
Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche
LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Item 8. Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data.

 

Item 9B. Other Information

 

Under the Iran Threat
Reduction and Syrian Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Honeywell is
required to disclose in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions
or dealings relating to Iran or with entities or individuals designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. All of our activities
in Iran during the three months ended December 31, 2016, including the activities disclosed below, were conducted by our non-U.S.
subsidiaries under General License H and otherwise in compliance with all applicable laws, including sanctions regulations administered
by U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

 

In the three months
ended December 31, 2016, the UOP business, part of Performance Materials and Technologies, engaged in the following activities
related to Iran’s oil, gas and/or petrochemical sectors:


86
    
    


·Settled
outstanding claims with Iranian counterparties under contracts originally entered into
in compliance with then-applicable sanctions laws. Revenue in the three months ended
December 31, 2016 from these settlements was approximately $28.6 million. 


·Delivered
services to Iranian counterparties pursuant to new and existing contracts, which resulted
in revenue of approximately $1.3 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016,
(expected total value of these contracts is approximately $4.2 million). 


·Sold
non-U.S. origin products to non-U.S. third-parties for end-use in Iran pursuant to new
and existing contracts, which resulted in revenue of approximately $0.1 million in the
three months ended December 31, 2016 (expected total value of these contracts is approximately
$0.9 million).

 

In the three months
ended December 31, 2016, the Process Solutions business, part of Performance Materials and Technologies, sold approximately $1.7
million of non-U.S. origin products to distributors (including an Iranian distributor) for use in the gas distribution sector
in Iran.

 

In the three months
ended December 31, 2016, the Industrial Safety business, part of Safety and Productivity Solutions, sold approximately $0.1 million
of non-U.S. origin products to a non-U.S. distributor for use in the oil sector in Iran.

 

In addition to the activities
described above, we previously disclosed in our periodic reports activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran occurring
in the first, second and third quarters of 2016. Our non-U.S. subsidiaries intend to continue doing business in Iran under General
License H in compliance with all applicable laws, which sales may require additional disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r) of the
Act.

(1)Equity
compensation plans approved by shareowners which are included in column (a) of the table
are the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2006 Stock Incentive
Plan (including 28,603,165 shares of Common Stock to be issued for options; 16,091 shares
to be issued for stock appreciation rights; 4,443,936 RSUs subject to continued employment;
and 1,884,115 deferred RSUs); and the 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors and
the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (including 297,014 shares of Common Stock
to be issued for options; and 23,407 RSUs subject to continued services). RSUs included
in column (a) of the table represent the full number of RSUs awarded and outstanding
whereas the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon vesting will be lower
than what is reflected on the table because the value of shares required to meet employee
tax withholding requirements are not issued.

 

1,336,202 growth plan units were
issued and remain outstanding for the performance cycle commencing January 1, 2014 and ended December 31, 2015 and 1,600,359 growth
plan units were issued and remain outstanding for the performance cycle commencing January 1, 2016 and ending December 31, 2017,
both pursuant to the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan. The value of this growth plan award will be paid in cash and, thus, growth plan
units are not included in the table above.

 

Because the number of future shares
that may be distributed to employees participating in the Honeywell Global Stock Plan is unknown, no shares attributable to that
plan are included in column (a) of the table above.

 


(2)Column
(b) relates to stock options and does not include any exercise price for RSUs because
an RSU’s value is dependent upon attainment of certain performance goals or continued
employment or service and they are settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one
basis.

 


(3)The
number of shares that may be issued under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan as of December
31, 2016 is 46,365,609 which includes the following additional shares that may again
be available for issuance: shares that are settled for cash, expire, are canceled, or
under similar prior plans, are tendered as option exercise price or tax withholding obligations,
are reacquired with cash option exercise price or with monies attributable to any tax
deduction enjoyed by Honeywell to the exercise of an option, or are under any outstanding
awards assumed under any equity compensation plan of an entity acquired by Honeywell.
No securities are available for future issuance under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan or
the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan.


89
    
    

The number of shares that may
be issued under the Honeywell Global Stock Plan as of December 31, 2016 is 1,906,977. This plan is an umbrella plan for three
plans described below maintained solely for eligible employees of participating non-U.S. countries.

 


·The
UK Sharebuilder Plan allows an eligible UK employee to invest taxable earnings in Common
Stock. The Company matches those shares and dividends paid are used to purchase additional
shares of Common Stock. For the year ending December 31, 2016, 58,353 shares were credited
to participants’ accounts under the UK Sharebuilder Plan.


·The
Honeywell International Technologies Employees Share Ownership Plan (Ireland) and the
Honeywell Measurex (Ireland) Limited Group Employee Profit Sharing Scheme, allow eligible
employees in Ireland to contribute specified percentages of base pay, bonus or performance
pay that are then invested in Common Stock. For the year ending December 31, 2016, 7,139
shares of Common Stock were credited to participants’ accounts under these two
plans.

 

The remaining 960,609 shares included
in column (c) are shares remaining under the 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors.

 


(4)Equity
compensation plans not approved by shareowners included in the table refers to the Supplemental
Non-Qualified Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees.

 

The Supplemental Non-Qualified
Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees is an unfunded, non-tax qualified plan that provides benefits equal to the employee
deferrals and company matching allocations that would have been provided under Honeywell’s U.S. tax-qualified savings plan
if the Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and contributions did not apply. The Company matching contribution is
credited to participants’ accounts in the form of notional shares of Common Stock. The notional shares are distributed in
the form of actual shares of Common Stock. The number of shares to be issued under this plan based on the value of the notional
shares as of December 31, 2016 is 438,998.

 

The AlliedSignal Incentive Compensation
Plan for Executive Employees was a cash incentive compensation plan maintained by AlliedSignal Inc. This plan has expired. Employees
were permitted to defer receipt of a cash bonus payable under the plan and invest the deferred bonus in notional shares of Common
Stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares of Common Stock. The number of shares of Common Stock
that remain to be issued as of December 31, 2016 is 8,741.

 


(5)Column
(b) does not include any exercise price for notional shares allocated to employees under
Honeywell’s equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners because all of
these shares are only settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis.

 


(6)The
amount of securities available for future issuance under the Supplemental Non-Qualified
Savings Plan for Highly Compensated Employees is not determinable because the number
of securities that may be issued under this plan depends upon the amount deferred to
the plan by participants in future years.

 

Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

 

Information relating
to certain relationships and related transactions is contained in the Proxy Statement referred to above in Item 10. Directors
and Executive Officers of the Registrant, and such information is incorporated herein by reference.

 

Item 14. Principal Accounting Fees and Services

 

Information relating to fees paid to and services performed
by Deloitte & Touche LLP and our Audit Committee’s pre-approval policies and procedures with respect to non-audit services
are contained in the Proxy Statement referred to above in Item 10. Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant, and such
information is incorporated herein by reference.
